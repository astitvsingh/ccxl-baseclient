## Description

`handleRateLimiting` is an abstract method in `BaseClient` designed to manage API rate limits imposed by the exchange. Derived classes must implement this method to handle rate limiting effectively, ensuring uninterrupted API interactions.

## Parameters

- `response` (object): The response object from the API request, which may contain rate limit information.

## Usage

This method is typically called within the `apiRequest` method of derived classes after each API response is received.

## Implementation

Derived classes should analyze the `response` object to determine if rate limiting is in effect and implement a strategy (like retrying or delaying subsequent requests) accordingly.

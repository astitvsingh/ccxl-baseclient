# BaseClient Class

## Introduction

The `BaseClient` class serves as an abstract base for building exchange-specific client classes. It defines a common interface and a set of functionalities that are essential for interacting with various cryptocurrency exchange APIs.

## Constructor

The constructor initializes the `BaseClient` with necessary credentials like `apiKey` API key and `secret`. It throws an error if an attempt is made to instantiate `BaseClient` directly, as it is designed to be an abstract class.

```javascript

  /**
   * Constructor for the BaseClient class.
   * @param {string} apiKey - The API key for the exchange.
   * @param {string} secret - The secret key for the exchange.
   */
  constructor(apiKey, secret) {
    if (this.constructor === BaseClient) {
      throw new Error(
        "BaseClient is an abstract class and cannot be instantiated directly."
      );
    }
    this.apiKey = apiKey;
    this.secret = secret;
    // Initialize other properties and rate limit handling mechanisms
  }

```

## Abstract Methods

`BaseClient` includes several abstract methods that must be implemented by any derived class. These methods cover a wide range of common functionalities like `handleRateLimiting` and `handleError` (error handling), `signRequest` and `apiRequest`.

### handleRateLimiting Method

#### handleRateLimiting Description

`handleRateLimiting` is an abstract method in `BaseClient` designed to manage API rate limits imposed by the exchange. Derived classes must implement this method to handle rate limiting effectively, ensuring uninterrupted API interactions.

#### handleRateLimiting Parameters

- `response` (object): The response object from the API request, which may contain rate limit information.

#### handleRateLimiting Usage

This method is typically called within the `apiRequest` method of derived classes after each API response is received.

#### handleRateLimiting Implementation

Derived classes should analyze the `response` object to determine if rate limiting is in effect and implement a strategy (like retrying or delaying subsequent requests) accordingly.

### handleError Method

#### handleError Description

`handleError` is an abstract method in `BaseClient` designed to manage API rate limits imposed by the exchange. Derived classes must implement this method to handle rate limiting effectively, ensuring uninterrupted API interactions.

#### handleError Parameters

- `response` (object): The response object from the API request, which may contain rate limit information.

#### handleError Usage

This method is typically called within the `apiRequest` method of derived classes after each API response is received.

#### handleError Implementation

Derived classes should analyze the `response` object to determine if rate limiting is in effect and implement a strategy (like retrying or delaying subsequent requests) accordingly.

### signRequest Method

#### signRequest Description

`signRequest` is an abstract method in `BaseClient` designed to manage API rate limits imposed by the exchange. Derived classes must implement this method to handle rate limiting effectively, ensuring uninterrupted API interactions.

#### signRequest Parameters

- `response` (object): The response object from the API request, which may contain rate limit information.

#### signRequest Usage

This method is typically called within the `apiRequest` method of derived classes after each API response is received.

#### signRequest Implementation

Derived classes should analyze the `response` object to determine if rate limiting is in effect and implement a strategy (like retrying or delaying subsequent requests) accordingly.

### apiRequest Method

#### apiRequest Description

`apiRequest` is an abstract method in `BaseClient` designed to manage API rate limits imposed by the exchange. Derived classes must implement this method to handle rate limiting effectively, ensuring uninterrupted API interactions.

#### apiRequest Parameters

- `response` (object): The response object from the API request, which may contain rate limit information.

#### apiRequest Usage

This method is typically called within the `apiRequest` method of derived classes after each API response is received.

#### apiRequest Implementation

Derived classes should analyze the `response` object to determine if rate limiting is in effect and implement a strategy (like retrying or delaying subsequent requests) accordingly.
